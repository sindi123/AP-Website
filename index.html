<p>COVID-19, also commonly referred to as coronavirus, is a virus that can be spread person from person. As such it is important that one takes the necessary measures to prevent the spread of it. That way, you can protect yourself and others around you</p>

<p>It is important to wash your hands often, either with soap or alcohol-based hand rub. You should also maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from others. If you cough or sneeze, make sure you cover your mouth/nose with tissues or elbow. Most importantly, if you notice that you showcase symptoms, consult with doctors. </p>
